# Subterrain

Custom tooling and methodology for exploring structurally performant water tight shell geometries inside polygonal planar cell boundaries and under distributed vertical load using Grasshopper + Kangaroo.

## Getting Started

### Dependancies

Grasshopper definitions and python scrips requires the following rhino/gh plugins to work:

```
Tsplines
Kangaroo
Weaverbird
GhPython
```

### How to use tool

Open sandbox.3dm, launch grasshopper and open sandbox.gh. Should have something like this:

## Roadmap

Would like to develop this into fully integrated system for subterrainian architecture, that allows users to manipulate user/building constraints in real-time and outputs closed mesh massing for rapid prototyping, and perhaps generates complete set of shop drawings for fabrication :). If you are interested in helping please let me know.
